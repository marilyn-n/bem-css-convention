# BEM — Block Element Modifier 

Is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development


## Naming

BEM is a simple naming convention that makes your front-end code easier to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit, and a lot more strict.

The BEM naming convention ensures that everyone who participates in the development project works with a single codebase and speaks the same language.
